    "## Understanding the topology of Landlab grids\n",
    "\n",
    "All grids consist of two interlocked sets of *points* joined by *lines* outlining *areas*. The data points are called **nodes**, which are joined by **links** which outline **patches**. Each node within the interior of the grid lies at the geometric center of the area of a **cell**. The cell's edges are **faces**, and the point at the edge of each face is a **corner**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this kind of scheme requires one set of features to be \"dominant\" over the other; i.e., either not every node has a cell, *or* not every link is crossed by a face. Both cannot be true, because one or other set of features has to define the edge of the grid. Landlab assumes that the **node set is primary**, so there are always more nodes than corners; more links than faces; and more patches than cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these sets of *\"elements\"* has its own set of IDs. These IDs are what allow us to index the various Landlab fields which store spatial data. Each feature is ordered by **x, then y**. The origin is always at the bottom left node, unless you choose to move it (`grid.move_origin`)... except in the specific case of a radial grid, where logic and symmetry dictates it must be the central node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final thing to know is that **lines have direction**. This lets us record fluxes on the grid by associating them with, and mapping them onto, the links (or, much less commonly, the faces). All lines point into the **upper right quadrant**. So, on our raster, this means the horizontal links point east an the vertical links point north.\n",
